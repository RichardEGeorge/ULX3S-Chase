# ULX3S-Chase

This is a simple LED chasing program for the ULX-S3 FPGA development board. It relies heavily on the work of DoctorWkt [available on GitHub](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/ULX3S-Blinky/). 

## Assumptions

I assume that you have a working ULX3S toolchain installed, and a ULX3S-85F board to run the code, which is [available from Crowdsupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/radiona/ulx3s)

## Building

Download the git repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/RichardEGeorge/ULX3SChase.git
```



then run:

```
make prog
```

## Output
